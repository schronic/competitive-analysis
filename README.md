# competitive-analysis

Based on similarweb data, via input of domains and timeframe the applciationr etruns a holistic assessment of competitive website performance based on a multitude of different features. 

In order to use to application to its fullest the google authentication library needes to be added manually, as well as the according path to the client_secret.json file specified. This is only needed in case a baseline (actual) is needed. 

The application in and of itself is not intended to be cloned and run locally, as a lot of it remains case specific. My hope is that snips of it, as well as the overarching idea and approach, are helpful for anyone working with similarweb.

Execution locally:
> node index.js
